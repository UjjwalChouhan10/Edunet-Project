# **Water Quality Prediction Using Artificial Intelligence**

# Project Description:
This project aims to develop an artificial intelligence (AI)-based system for predicting water quality based on various chemical and physical parameters. Access to clean and safe drinking water is a critical global challenge, and traditional water testing methods can be time-consuming, expensive, and require laboratory infrastructure.

By leveraging machine learning techniques, this project automates the prediction of water potability using real-world datasets containing features such as pH, turbidity, hardness, total dissolved solids (TDS), and more. The model classifies water samples as potable or non-potable, enabling faster decision-making and proactive water resource management.

The project involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, model selection and training, performance evaluation, and interpretation of results. It demonstrates the potential of AI to provide cost-effective and scalable solutions for environmental monitoring and public health.
